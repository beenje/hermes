### Caveat

This cli was developed to improve my workflow. I am lacking knowledge
regarding Jira's json structure, resulting in imperfections when
printing list of tickets, have been desiged based on my personal
tickets. Furthermore, only a small selection of features habe been
implemented, based on my own need. Please feel free to contribute!
